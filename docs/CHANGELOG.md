# CHANGELOG.md

Corpus versions. Appended to, never rewritten.

The corpus is versioned as a whole rather than per document, so a version identifies
one consistent set of documents. `PROGRESS.md` records which corpus version the build
was working against.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-05

Initial corpus, written before any code exists.

- `CLAUDE.md` with sixteen invariants specific to this lab and the stage pattern
- `ARCHITECTURE.html`, 33 components across 7 layers, 11 figures
- `DECISIONS.md`, D-1 through D-55, all settled during scoping
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`, phases P and 0 through 10 with definitions of done
- `SCHEMA.md` with single-writer ownership per table
- `VALIDITY.md` with pre-registered thresholds
- `WORKED_EXAMPLE.md` tracing one candidate end to end
- `CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`, roughly 45 keys, all consumers unverified
- `GLOSSARY.md`, `FIXTURES.md` empty, `RUNBOOK.md`, `PROGRESS.md` empty
- `prompts/` with the five rubrics, prefix template, candidate block format and
  digest instruction, plus `prompts/spent/` holding three issued prompts

Repository conventions: .NET 10, `.slnx`, central package management, root holding
only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, secrets in `appsettings.Secrets.json`, EODHD
dash-form tickers, append-only versioned config. Postgres throughout.
